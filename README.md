# Technical Features
- Supports all major port forwarding protocols (UPnP, NAT-PMP, and PCP) for the best possible router compatibility
- Supports streaming on IPv4-only, IPv6-only, and dual-stack Internet connections
- Supports successful forwarding in double-NAT environments by configuring port mappings on all NATs found on the way to the Internet
- Supports forwarding on Carrier-Grade NATs (CGNs) by directly using PCP when the ISP doesn't implement UPnP-PCP interoperability
